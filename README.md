The main objective of the project was to perform source code summarization, source code summarization is the task of generating a high-level natural language description for a segment of programming language code.

All the files related to the project can be found in :
(base) ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-101:~/work/from_shanu/ExplainCodePython$

To run the files we need to install sentence piece, transformers and Torchvision package

We can write the code in the file.txt file present in the same folder of the python file and run the program to obtain the summary of the code.
